//! The provider seam: the model/streaming interface faux and real providers
//! implement.
//!
//! # What this abstracts in pi
//!
//! pi routes every model call through a provider's `stream()` /`streamSimple()`
//! functions (`Provider`/`ApiProvider` in `compat.ts`), and its tests swap the
//! whole provider out with `registerFauxProvider()` — a scripted, deterministic
//! provider that drives pi's real streaming path. The mock-seam inventory
//! (`notes/mock-inventory.md`) attributes 22 collaborator sites to this seam: the
//! agent and coding-agent suites register a faux provider and assert on the event
//! sequence and final message it produces.
//!
//! This trait is that boundary in Rust. A provider takes a model, a [`Context`],
//! and [`StreamOptions`], and yields the uniform [`AssistantMessageEvent`]
//! sequence plus the accumulated [`AssistantMessage`] — the same contract pi's
//! `stream()` fulfils.
//!
//! # Streaming model
//!
//! pi streams asynchronously through an `AssistantMessageEventStream`. The Rust
//! core produces the event sequence **eagerly** as a [`StreamResult`] (mirroring
//! the Stage-2 Anthropic parser, which returns its events and final message as a
//! value); the async iterable and inter-chunk timing are re-presented at the
//! binding boundary (the napi shim replays `events` into pi's
//! `AssistantMessageEventStream`). Determinism lives here; scheduling lives at the
//! edge.
//!
//! # Implementations
//!
//! - [`crate::providers::faux::FauxProvider`] — the deterministic test provider,
//!   a byte-compatible port of pi's `providers/faux.ts`. This is the provider the
//!   conformance suite drives.
//! - Real providers (Anthropic and the rest) implement this same trait as their
//!   HTTP/streaming paths land; Stage 2 ported the Anthropic SSE decode that a
//!   real Anthropic `Provider` will build on.
